  Poll: "Crucial juncture point of the horse. Discomfort & tension anywhere in the horse's body may collect in this area as well. When the poll is rigid, it can affect the balance & performance of the entire body. Examples include resistance to bend the neck, loss of front end extension, difficult lead changes & inability to engage hindquarters.",
  'Masseter Muscle/Cheek':
    'This is the primary muscle involved in chewing and moves the jaw. Cribbing or incorrect usage of the reins when riding can cause discomfort and tension in the muscle.',
  'Rectus Capitus Lateralis':
    'Allows the head to flex and incline side to side. Tightness generally results in obvious head discomfort, resistance to sideways movement in the opposite direction & may pull the head to one side, with a low head carriage. The horse may make continuous stretching motions with the head.',
  Splenius:
    'Allows the neck to bend. Tightness results in poor head carriage, and lack of flexion throughout the neck. Difficulty or inability to stretch the head & neck to the right and/or left will often be observed.',
  'Multifidus Cervicus':
    'Allows the neck to flex and the head to rotate to the opposite side. Tightness generally results in the horse resisting neck motion in the opposite direction. Loss of elasticity in any gait, as well as over fences may also be noted.',
  'Trapezius/Rhomboids':
    'Allows the shoulders to raise, and permits the scapula to draw upward, forward, and back. Tightness generally results in loss of shoulder movement, loss of suspension, compromised motion in the front limbs, and overall loss of coordination up front. Mis-timing over jumps may be observed.',
  Deltoid:
    'Permits the shoulders joint to extend. Tightness generally results in a shortened range of motion in the front limbs, making extension difficult to execute, and loss of ability over fences.',
  Tricep:
    'Permits the shoulder to flex. Tightness generally results in dishing, a shortened range of motion in the front limbs, hanging a leg over a fence, uncomfortable lead, and difficulty getting & maintaining a lead, as well as a look of unsoundness when asked to extend in the gait of trot.',
  'Pectorals Transversus/Pectoralis Descendens/Pectoral Muscles':
    'The girth runs across this area & it is fairly common to see discomfort in these muscles due to tightening the girth too much. These muscles each possess some ability to bring the front leg closer to the trunk in retraction, to draw the front limb backwards, as well as work with other muscles to suspend the trunk through the front legs.',
  'Latissimus Dorsi':
    'Permits lateral bending, draws the foreleg backwards & flexes the shoulder. Tightness generally results in a general lack of range of motion to the front limbs, loss of ability over fences, compromised lateral responses & loss of general balance.',
  'Longissimus Dorsi':
    'Allows the back to extend, and permit lateral bending. Tightness generally results in a sore back, loss of coordinated power while in motion, restricted movement with respect to lateralmovements, a general stiff back, difficulty engaging, loss of ability over fences, overall loss of power from the hindquarters.',
  'Intercostal Muscles/Rib Cage':
    "Tension in this area can lead to hypersensitivity when the girth is tightened, & hypersensitivity when the rider's leg is applied. It can also present as difficulty bending through the rib cage & hesitation when asked to move sideways/laterally. These muscles draw the ribs upward & forward & aid in respiration.",
  'Hip/Illiacus (False Hip)':
    'Permits hip joint flexion and rotates thigh outward. Tightness generally results in off hind leg motion, horse may “scuff” or drag its toes, may drop a hind limb over a fence, the hind limb may actually buckle, especially while moving on a circle, and will have a shortened length of step in that hind limb.',
  Gluteus:
    'Allows forward movement, hind end action, flexes the hip & extends the stifle. Tightness generally results in restricted hip movement, overall back discomfort, a shortened forward stride, and a compromised range of hind leg forward motion. A general loss of power from the hindquarter.',
  'Tensor Fascia Latae':
    'Allows the stifle to extend and the hip to flex. Tightness generally results in the horse throwing the affected leg outwards on the forward stride, restricting lateral movements. Loss of impulsion, a shortened stride, and a slower stride on the affected limb will often be noted.'
